abstract: "The proliferation of Illegal Movie Streaming Services (IMSS) has posed significant challenges to legitimate streaming services and law enforcement alike, causing financial losses and complicating efforts to combat copyright infringement.
Motivated by the absence of a comprehensive list of IMSS, and recognizing that IMSS websites often have short-lived domains, we first introduce a methodology to detect IMSS sites. 
Our evaluation demonstrates that our method achieves a recall of 84.31% in identifying IMSS.
Applying this method on the Tranco Top 1M domains, we find 283 new websites hosting IMSS.
When characterizing the IMSS ecosystem, our findings reveal that four specific IMSS sites attract considerable attention, appearing in the Tranco Top 10K domains.
Additionally, these sites employ complex redirection patterns, with  one site using up to 11 hops to evade detection. 
Using Google Identifiers, we then uncover 11 cases of co-ownership, where multiple sites share the same identifiers, indicating common operation.
Finally, by crawling IMSS sites from seven vantage points (VPs), we investigate online tracking practices on these services â€” an area that has previously lacked thorough investigation.
We find that more than 95% of IMSS include at least one third-party tracker on their websites.
Interestingly, tracker presence is lower in the European Union (EU) countries than in other VPs.
Furthermore, third-party tracking cookies are not the primary mechanism on IMSS sites; instead, the more invasive and unavoidable fingerprinting techniques are predominantly used for tracking across different VPs."
