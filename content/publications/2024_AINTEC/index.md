abstract: "Single Sign-On (SSO) enables users to access multiple websites and applications using a single set of login credentials. Undoubtedly, SSO makes it easy for users to log in to multiple websites without remembering credentials. However, it is also important to consider the potential risk of users being unaware of how the identity of their account will be utilized, the development of online tracking techniques, and any potential exchange of information with third parties without the userâ€™s knowledge. In this paper, we proposeSSOLogin, which enables us to perform large-scale automation of website login through an SSO account. We confirm that SSOLoginautomatically logins to 91.8% of SSO account available websites inTranco Top 500 sites. Next, by crawling Tranco Top 10K websites with SSOLogin, we show that 1,420 sites (14.2%) contain SSO login(Google and Facebook) as of July 2023, primarily on InformationTechnology and News/Media websites in the United States and the United Kingdom. We then shed light on the characteristics of privacy leakage of websites with SSO logins by setting up measurements in Japan. We find that 99% of websites have third-party online tracking activities, which may pose risks to user privacy. After SSOlogin, the target website shows an increase in third-party tracking domains. Logging in with Google adds 81 new tracking domains, while Facebook adds 33 new domains. Despite the convenience of logging in with an SSO account, it is important to be aware of the potential privacy risks associated with this practice."
