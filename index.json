Motivated by the absence of a comprehensive list of IMSS, and recognizing that IMSS websites often have short-lived domains, we first introduce a methodology to detect IMSS sites. Our evaluation demonstrates that our method achieves a recall of 84.31% in identifying IMSS. Applying this method on the Tranco Top 1M domains, we find 283 new websites hosting IMSS. When characterizing the IMSS ecosystem, our findings reveal that four specific IMSS sites attract considerable attention, appearing in the Tranco Top 10K domains. Additionally, these sites employ complex redirection patterns, with  one site using up to 11 hops to evade detection. Using Google Identifiers, we then uncover 11 cases of co-ownership, where multiple sites share the same identifiers, indicating common operation. Finally, by crawling IMSS sites from seven vantage points (VPs), we investigate online tracking practices on these services — an area that has previously lacked thorough investigation. We find that more than 95% of IMSS include at least one third-party tracker on their websites. Interestingly, tracker presence is lower in the European Union (EU) countries than in other VPs. Furthermore, third-party tracking cookies are not the primary mechanism on IMSS sites; instead, the more invasive and unavoidable fingerprinting techniques are predominantly used for tracking across different VPs.","tags":null,"title":"Unmasking the Shadows: A Cross-Country Study of Online Tracking in Illegal Movie Streaming Services","type":"publications"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Systems that interest me Soft matter systems, such as polymers and proteins Fluids in confined environments or near interfaces ","date":1735776e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1735776e3,"objectID":"b8cbf49582fc476055c372b0995ed85b","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/gallery/systems.html","publishdate":"2025-01-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/gallery/systems.html","section":"gallery","summary":"Systems that interest me Soft matter systems, such as polymers and proteins Fluids in confined environments or near interfaces ","tags":null,"title":"","type":"gallery"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Preferred method Molecular simulations, particulalry when it can be compared to experiments like neutrons or NMR.\n","date":1735689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1735689600,"objectID":"5dba78648dd0053d9a7bceb28321462d","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/gallery/methods.html","publishdate":"2025-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/gallery/methods.html","section":"gallery","summary":"Preferred method Molecular simulations, particulalry when it can be compared to experiments like neutrons or NMR.","tags":null,"title":"","type":"gallery"},{"authors":["Maximilian Zöllner","Anja Feldmann","**Ha Dao**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1735689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1735689600,"objectID":"4932c3f4b48921a453f0bad5784ffb8f","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/publications/2025_pam.html","publishdate":"2025-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/2025_pam.html","section":"publications","summary":"The introduction of Cookies Having Independent Partitioned State (CHIPS) marks a significant step toward balancing user privacy with essential web functionalities. CHIPS isolates data within specific contexts, preventing cross-site tracking while maintaining the functionality of websites. However, the adoption of CHIPS in real-world web usage remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the state of CHIPS deployment, providing an overview of how CHIPS has been integrated into web ecosystems since its introduction. Leveraging the HTTP Archive dataset, we first find that the adoption of partitioned cookies remains slow, with most domains still relying on non-partitioned cookies, though a slight increase in both types is observed starting in early 2024, coinciding with Google's phase-out of third-party cookies for 1% of users. This sudden onset of the third-party cookie phase-out has resulted in a haphazard way of adoption for some domains, which caused them to overlook important configuration requirements, resulting in improper settings due to limited awareness of the specific guidelines such as SameSite=None and Secure. In addition, we observe a positive signal for privacy as third-party trackers begin adopting partitioned cookies, with a noticeable increase starting in early 2024. However, as of September 2024, only a small number of trackers have fully transitioned to using partitioned cookies (up to 0.5% of tracking domains), while some continue to rely on both partitioned and non-partitioned cookies (up to 3.1% of tracking domains), highlighting that the shift is still in its early stages, especially for tracking domains. Finally, we observe stark asymmetry among the early adopter tracking domains: some have already added some partitioned cookies to all sites with a presence, while others, notably Google's doubleclick.com has only deployed partitioned cookies to around 5% of pages where it is present.","tags":null,"title":"A First Look at Cookies Having Independent Partitioned State","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Mateo Ormeno","Ha Dao","Valeria Herskovic","Kensuke Fukuda"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1731024e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1731024e3,"objectID":"bc4e5d56522ac474028bc95db36daf68","permalink":"https://simongravelle.github.io/publications/2024_ieeeaccess.html","publishdate":"2024-11-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/2024_ieeeaccess.html","section":"publications","summary":"Online behavioral advertising (OBA) is a method within digital advertising that exploits web users’ interests to tailor ads. Its use has raised privacy concerns among researchers, regulators, and the media, emphasizing the need for a reliable mechanism to measure its prevalence. However, there is a lack of systematic research on how user consent choices affect OBA presence, and no open-source frameworks exist for large-scale automated OBA measurement. To address this, we design and implement OpenOBA, a new framework for automated OBA discovery on the web. OpenOBA is a general, modular, and scalable framework to support essentially any OBA measurement. With it, we conduct a study to measure the impact of three user consent choices for cookies on OBA, uncovering a complex online privacy landscape. We first confirm the presence of OBA by comparing the increased likelihood of encountering ads from a specific topic, i.e., Style \u0026 Fashion, when browsing with an artificially induced behavior versus when browsing without any particular behavior. Then, we find that the Accept All choice significantly raises the number of OBA ads. For the Reject All option, on the other hand, we observe that it reduces the number of unique third-party tracking cookie hosts (tracker domains) by around 70%, yet it still shows ads related to the user’s interests. Notably, we also find that OBA ads are only served through Google-related domains across the three banner interaction configurations used, despite the involvement of up to 191 different tracker domains in the Accept All configuration. This underscores the dominant role of major players in the OBA ad market. Finally, to foster reproducibility and further research, we open-sourced our framework and released all data and analysis scripts.","tags":null,"title":"Do Cookie Banners Respect My Browsing Privacy?

Undoubtedly, SSO makes it easy for users to log in to multiple websites without remembering credentials. However, it is also important to consider the potential risk of users being unaware of how the identity of their account will be utilized, the development of online tracking techniques, and any potential exchange of information with third parties without the user’s knowledge. In this paper, we proposeSSOLogin, which enables us to perform large-scale automation of website login through an SSO account. We confirm that SSOLoginautomatically logins to 91.8% of SSO account available websites inTranco Top 500 sites. Next, by crawling Tranco Top 10K websites with SSOLogin, we show that 1,420 sites (14.2%) contain SSO login(Google and Facebook) as of July 2023, primarily on InformationTechnology and News/Media websites in the United States and the United Kingdom. We then shed light on the characteristics of privacy leakage of websites with SSO logins by setting up measurements in Japan. We find that 99% of websites have third-party online tracking activities, which may pose risks to user privacy. After SSOlogin, the target website shows an increase in third-party tracking domains. Logging in with Google adds 81 new tracking domains, while Facebook adds 33 new domains. Despite the convenience of logging in with an SSO account, it is important to be aware of the potential privacy risks associated with this practice.","tags":null,"title":"Do Cookie Banners Respect My Browsing Privacy?
